        <p>
            To make a delicious homemade pizza, start by preheating your oven to 475°F (245°C). 
            For the dough, combine 2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, 1 packet (2 ¼ tsp) active dry yeast, 1 tsp sugar, and ½ tsp salt in
             a bowl. Mix in ¾ cup warm water and 2 tbsp olive oil, knead for about 5 minutes, and let it rise for 1 hour.
              For the sauce, blend 1 cup tomato sauce with 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp garlic powder, ½ tsp dried basil, and a pinch of
               salt. Roll out the dough on a floured surface, spread the sauce evenly over it, then top with 1 ½ cups shredded 
               mozzarella cheese and your favorite toppings (like pepperoni, bell peppers, and onions). Bake for 12-15
                minutes until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Slice and enjoy your homemade pizza!
