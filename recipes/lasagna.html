            To make a delicious lasagna, start by cooking lasagna noodles until al dente, then drain and set aside.
             For the meat sauce, brown ground beef with minced garlic and onions until cooked through. Add crushed tomatoes,
              tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper, simmering for about 20 minutes.
               In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese with an egg, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper.
                To assemble, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of noodles,
                 then ricotta mixture, mozzarella cheese, and more meat sauce. Repeat layers until the dish is filled,
                  finishing with a layer of meat sauce and mozzarella cheese on top. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C)
                   for 30-35 minutes, or until bubbly and golden brown. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
                    Enjoy your homemade lasagna!
