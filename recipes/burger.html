    <h2>Burger recipe</h2>
    <p>
        To make delicious cheeseburgers, preheat your grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Season 1 lb of ground beef with 
        1 tsp salt and Â½ tsp black pepper, then shape into 4 patties. Cook the patties for 4-5 minutes per side, or until they 
        reach your desired doneness, adding a slice of cheddar cheese to each patty during the last minute of cooking. While 
        the patties cook, lightly toast 4 hamburger buns in a pan or on the grill. Assemble the burgers by placing the cooked 
        patties on the bottom half of each bun, then top with lettuce leaves, tomato slices, pickles, and any desired condiments 
        like ketchup and mustard. Cover with the top half of the bun, serve, and enjoy your homemade cheeseburgers!
